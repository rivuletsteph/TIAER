# TIAER
Hello - My background is in GIS and water quality, so I am a novice at programming.
The purpose of this repository is to be able to share the notebooks that myself and  
colleagues at the Texas Institute for Applied Environmental Reserach at Tarleton 
State University in Stephenville, Texas have created to access the National Water 
Model Retrospective Dataset.
Thanks for looking and feel free to email me at sbrady@tarleton.edu.
