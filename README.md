# TIAER
Welcome. 
The purpose of this repository is to be able to share the notebooks that myself and  
colleagues at the Texas Institute for Applied Environmental Research and the College
of Agriculture at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, Texas have created to 
access the National Water Model Retrospective Dataset. More info is located within 
the header of each notebook.  
These were all created in Google Colab.  
Thanks for looking and feel free to email me with comments at sbrady@tarleton.edu.
